# How to Use Flatiron for 3ds Max to Bake Full Scenes into a Single UV Map
` `
Flatiron is a powerful render-to-texture plug-in for 3ds Max that can bake full scenes or selections of objects into a single UV map with only a few clicks. It is based on the Unwrella technology, which provides high-quality automatic unwrapping and baking solutions. Flatiron can greatly speed up the process of baking complex scenes and create realistic textures for game levels, architectural scenes, industrial design and more.

` `
In this article, we will show you how to use Flatiron for 3ds Max to bake a scene with multiple objects into a single UV map. We will use the example of a canalisation scene, which you can download from the Flatiron homepage[^1^]. You will need Flatiron version 1.12 or higher, which is compatible with 3ds Max 9-2021 (32-bit and 64-bit) [^2^].
` `
## Step 1: Load the scene and select the objects
` `
Open the canalisation scene in 3ds Max and select all the objects that you want to bake into a single UV map. You can use the Select by Name dialog or the Scene Explorer to select multiple objects at once. Make sure that the objects have proper material IDs assigned, as Flatiron will use them to create different texture sets.
` `
## Step 2: Open the Flatiron dialog and set the parameters
` `
Go to Rendering > Render To Texture and click on the Flatiron button to open the Flatiron dialog. Here you can set various parameters for the unwrapping and baking process, such as:
` `
`
`- The output size and format of the UV map
`
`- The padding and spacing between UV islands
`
`- The number of texture sets and their names
`
`- The type of projection (planar, cylindrical, spherical or best fit)
`
`- The type of baking (diffuse, normal, specular, etc.)
`
`- The output folder and file name
`
`
` `
For this example, we will use the following settings:
` `
`
`- Output size: 2048 x 2048 pixels
`
`- Output format: PNG
`
`- Padding: 4 pixels
`
`- Spacing: 4 pixels
`
`- Texture sets: 2 (one for metal parts and one for concrete parts)
`
`- Projection: Best fit
`
`- Baking: Diffuse color only
`
`- Output folder: C:\Flatiron\Canalisation\
`
`- File name: Canalisation\_Diffuse.png
`
`
` `
## Step 3: Start the unwrapping and baking process
` `
Once you have set all the parameters, click on the Start button to begin the unwrapping and baking process. Flatiron will automatically create a new UV channel for each object and pack them into a single UV map according to your settings. It will also render the selected baking type for each object and save them as separate texture sets in the output folder.
` `
The unwrapping and baking process may take some time depending on the complexity of your scene and your hardware specifications. You can monitor the progress in the status bar of the Flatiron dialog. When it is done, you will see a message saying "Flatiron finished successfully". You can also check the log file for any errors or warnings.
` `
## Step 4: Apply the baked texture to your scene
` `
After the unwrapping and baking process is completed, you can apply the baked texture to your scene. To do this, you need to create a new material with a bitmap texture map that uses the baked texture as its source. You can use any material type that supports bitmap textures, such as Standard or Physical.
` `
Create a new material and assign it to one of the objects in your scene. Then go to its Diffuse Color map slot
